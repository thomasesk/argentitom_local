Life is a strange thing. This short text is about sharing strange feelings one can have those days. Feelings I sure have.<br>
In an era of so-called ‚Äúcomplexity‚Äù, I see the world as a simple thing. It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre the only sober guy in a room full of drunk people. Most of them look happy, joyful and seems to be having fun. Still, they are acting weirdly. It‚Äôs a fact, they‚Äôre just drunk.<br><br>

I feel like they are two options. One is keeping a low-profile, try to enjoy some of the beautiful things that exist and live a peaceful life, far from any intellectual thoughts, any ‚Äúcaring‚Äù about stuff and go do your own shit in your corner. Maybe you can try to have impact ‚Äúon the side‚Äù. The other would be to engage, try to have an impact and to change stuff. It really feels that this is a choice, but it truly isn‚Äôt.

Two approaches to our situation, the scientific one and the emotional one. Do we all get the issue here?<br><br>

I believe those two approaches are important, but the emotional one is often left aside. Understanding of the situation we are in, deeply, is sad. Sadness is not a bad thing, on the opposite, it is an essential part of that grieving process we must accept in order to change things. Indeed, before changing ‚Äúthings‚Äù, we need to change ourselves. The situation we are in today is our fault. And if we are there, it sure means there is something wrong about us, about how we interact and value life. There is a problem in how we envision our own lives, the goals we set for ourselves and the metrics we use to compare one another. As if it was not hard enough, our societies condemn sadness. Like if it was a disease. One must be happy. If not, one is lost, probably depressed, and should be taken care of. Somehow, I think the opposite. If you‚Äôre being lucid about the way, we live today and its consequences, I don‚Äôt really see how you can be happy. Sadness is an intelligent response to the situation. Again, it is an inevitable step towards change and acceptation.<br><br>

To keep it short, we are emptying our oceans and must species be disappearing. It is sad. Inequalities are dramatically increasing; burnouts are now a common thing, and our behavior will very likely cause the extinction of human race. This is sad.<br><br>

There are no happy answers to that. Capitalism coupled with exploitation of new energy sources has given us amazing powers, incredible capabilities. It also brought the worst of us, enhancing our greed and our spirit of competition, leaving aside solidarity and sobriety. It was cool while we were ignorant, but we are not anymore, so let‚Äôs be sad and try to move on.
